# Northwind Data Cleaning Project

I completed this project in the Microsoft SQL Server. This project, challenged by Emmanuel Segui, emphasized cleaning of the "Northwind" data set. The following prompts were given:

--Find and remove the duplciates in the "Customers" column by using common table expressions.

--Categorize the column "freight" into low, medium, and high charges based on the amount of cargo in each freight shipment using CASE statements.

--Find and remove NULLs in the Customers column.

--Create multiple conditions that show what products need to be restocked as well as when to restock them.

--Replace null values in the "fax" column, then identify the rows fitting this condition using common table expressions. 

This project included the folliowing SQL functions and clauses: CTEs, ISNULL, CASE WHEN, THEN, END AS, and ROW_NUMBER().
